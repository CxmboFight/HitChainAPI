## **Installation & Setup** 🛠️

### 1. **Clone the Repository**

Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CxmboFight/HitChainAPI.git
```

### 2. **Build the Project**

If you're using **Maven**, simply run:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

If you're using **Gradle**, run:

```bash
gradle build
```

This will generate the necessary `.jar` file for your plugin.

### 3. **Install the Plugin on Your Server**

* Place the generated `HitChainAPI.jar` file in your **server's plugin directory**.
* Restart the server to load the plugin.
* The plugin will automatically create the default configuration files (`config.yml`, `messages.yml`, etc.) in the plugin's folder.

### 4. **Configuration**

Edit the `config.yml` to tailor the plugin to your server's needs. You can customize a wide variety of settings, from message formatting to data storage preferences.

## **Example Code** 📝

Here’s a simple example of how you can use **HitChainAPI** in your plugin:

```java
public class MyPlugin extends HitChainPlugin {

    @Override
    public void onEnable() {
        // Registering commands
        getCommand("mycommand").setExecutor(new MyCommandExecutor());

        // Handling events
        getServer().getPluginManager().registerEvents(new PlayerListener(), this);

        // Accessing utility classes
        MessageUtil.sendMessage(player, "Welcome to the server!", MessageUtil.MessageType.INFO);
    }
}
```
